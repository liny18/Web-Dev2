Reflection:

This is definitely the biggest and the most challenging lab I have done for Web Sci and Web sys, but also the one that I have learned the most from. I picked up the entire MERN stack except for Mongo, Typescript, Tailwind, Vite, and lots of Linux terminal knowledge.

Throughout this lab, there were countless times where my code is not doing what I intended. But I was able to solve most  of them thanks to Stackoverflow and Chatgpt. The backend is very straightforward. I have 75 lines including empty ones in total in my server.js. The frontend however was quite confusing considering this is my first React project plus I severely underestimated the complexity of Typescript. Typescript was a pain to use. I spent at least 3 hours on this lab sitting there staring at my code trying to figure out what type an object should be alone. It was not until I was done with my frontend implementation did I figure out that there's an over powered plugging called "JSON to code" which allows you to copy and paste JSON and convert to Typescript! However, Typescript wasn't the most annoying thing in this lab. The biggest pain for me was to host this lab on Azure. Shout out to the kings that pulled a node server tutorial doc together otherwise I probably would have spent 5 extra hours trying to figure everything else by myself and end up nowhere. With node server set up(thanks to Sam's help), I thought that was it, frontend should be easy to setup. But no, I was devastatingly wrong. I had a huge headache trying to build my React App on Azure. I couldn't figure out why my index.html couldn't find my other files, which costed me somewhere from 2 to 3 hours. Big thanks to Aj(the goat) I got it to work eventually. Turns out I just had to change some linking between my files; sounds easy but I searched everywhere and couldn't find a solution(idk how AJ did it maybe I'm just stupid).


Creativity:

Good UI imo. Good use of API response imo.
