Log:

This lab was pretty chill for me since I've already got experience with MongoDB. All I had to do was look up the Node syntax, which was no biggie with so many resources online and ChatGPT to help me out. I didn't get stuck or anything, but there was a bit of trial and error to get things just right. All in all, I'd say this lab was on the easy side, especially since there wasn't much frontend stuff to deal with.
